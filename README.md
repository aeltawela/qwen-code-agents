## Why This Exists

Claude Code is expensive. Qwen Code is free (OAuth: 60 req/min, 1000/day) or very cheap (API key). This project brings the same powerful agent orchestration system to Qwen Code so you can use 202 specialized AI agents **without paying for Claude**.

### Before vs After

| Aspect | Before (Claude Code) | After (Qwen Code) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Cost** | $3+ per 1M tokens (Sonnet) | Free (OAuth) or ~$0.02/1M tokens |
| **Model for critical tasks** | Claude Opus 4.6 | Qwen-Max |
| **Model for complex tasks** | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Qwen-Plus |
| **Model for fast tasks** | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Qwen-Flash |
| **Plugins** | 92 | 92 (same) |
| **Agents** | 202 | 202 (same expertise) |
| **Skills** | 183 | 183 (same knowledge) |
| **Commands** | 105 | 105 (same workflows) |
| **Agent knowledge** | Identical | Identical |
| **Skill content** | Identical | Identical |
| **Workflow automation** | Identical | Identical |
| **Monthly savings** | Baseline | **~99% cheaper** |

### What Changed vs What Stayed

| Component | Changed? | Details |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Agent system prompts | No | All 202 agents have identical expertise |
| Skill knowledge packages | No | All 183 skills with progressive disclosure |
| Command workflows | No | All 96 workflow automations |
| Plugin structure | No | Same directory organization |
| `model: opus` references | Yes | Mapped to `model: qwen-max` |
| `model: sonnet` references | Yes | Mapped to `model: qwen-plus` |
| `model: haiku` references | Yes | Mapped to `model: qwen-flash` |
| Plugin manifest | Yes | `plugin.json` + `qwen-extension.json` |
| Context files | Added | `QWEN.md` per plugin |

## Overview

This unified repository provides everything needed for intelligent automation and multi-agent orchestration across modern software development:

- **77 Focused Plugins** - Granular, single-purpose plugins optimized for minimal token usage and composability
- **202 Specialized Agents** - Domain experts with deep knowledge across architecture, languages, infrastructure, quality, data/AI, documentation, business operations, and SEO
- **183 Agent Skills** - Modular knowledge packages with progressive disclosure for specialized expertise
- **16 Workflow Orchestrators** - Multi-agent coordination systems for complex operations like full-stack development, security hardening, ML pipelines, and incident response
- **96 Commands** - Optimized utilities including project scaffolding, security scanning, test automation, and infrastructure setup

### Key Features

- **Granular Plugin Architecture**: 77 focused plugins optimized for minimal token usage
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: 105 commands including test generation, scaffolding, and security scanning
- **100% Agent Coverage**: All plugins include specialized agents
- **Agent Skills**: 183 specialized skills following for progressive disclosure and token efficiency
- **Clear Organization**: 24 categories with 1-10 plugins each for easy discovery
- **Efficient Design**: Average 3.6 components per plugin (follows Anthropic's 2-8 pattern)

### How It Works

Each plugin is completely isolated with its own agents, commands, and skills:

- **Install only what you need** - Each plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills
- **Minimal token usage** - No unnecessary resources loaded into context
- **Mix and match** - Compose multiple plugins for complex workflows
- **Clear boundaries** - Each plugin has a single, focused purpose
- **Progressive disclosure** - Skills load knowledge only when activated

**Example**: Installing `python-development` loads 3 Python agents, 1 scaffolding tool, and makes 16 skills available (~1000 tokens), not the entire marketplace.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Qwen Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/qwen-code
qwen --version
```

### Step 2: Authenticate (Free)

```bash
# Free tier: 60 requests/min, 1,000 requests/day
qwen auth qwen-oauth

# Or use API key for higher limits
qwen auth api-key
```

### Step 3: Clone This Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aeltawela/qwen-code-agents.git
cd qwen-code-agents
```

### Step 4: Install Extensions

For a single plugin, use Qwen Code's native installer (recommended):

```bash
qwen extensions install --consent https://github.com/aeltawela/qwen-code-agents:python-development
```

For a local bulk install, use this repository's Python helper:

```bash
# Install ALL 92 plugins as Qwen Code extensions
python3 tools/install-qwen-extensions.py

# Or install multiple selected plugins in one run
python3 tools/install-qwen-extensions.py --plugins python-development backend-development conductor

# View available plugins
python3 tools/install-qwen-extensions.py --list
```

### Step 5: Start Using

```bash
qwen
```

```bash
# Try a command
/conductor:setup

# Use an agent
"Use python-pro to write async API code"

# View skills
/skills

# Manage agents
/agents manage
```

### Plugins & What They Bundle

| Plugin | Agents | Skills |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `python-development` | python-pro, django-pro, fastapi-pro | 16 skills |
| `javascript-typescript` | typescript-pro | 4 skills |
| `backend-development` | backend-architect, graphql-specialist | 3 skills |
| `conductor` | conductor-validator | 3 skills |
| `full-stack-orchestration` | 7 specialized agents | orchestration |
| `security-scanning` | security-auditor | 8 skills |

### Troubleshooting

**Commands not found** → Restart Qwen Code after installing extensions.

**Extensions not appearing** → Check they're in the correct directory:
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.qwen\extensions\`
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.qwen/extensions/`

**Rate limit errors** → Switch from OAuth to API key:
```bash
qwen auth api-key
```

## What's New

### PluginEval — Quality Evaluation Framework (NEW)

A three-layer evaluation framework for measuring and certifying plugin/skill quality:

```bash
/plugin install plugin-eval@claude-code-workflows
```

- **Three Evaluation Layers** — Static analysis (instant), LLM judge (semantic), Monte Carlo simulation (statistical)
- **10 Quality Dimensions** — Triggering accuracy, orchestration fitness, output quality, scope calibration, progressive disclosure, token efficiency, robustness, structural completeness, code template quality, ecosystem coherence
- **Quality Badges** — Platinum (★★★★★), Gold (★★★★), Silver (★★★), Bronze (★★)
- **Anti-Pattern Detection** — OVER_CONSTRAINED, EMPTY_DESCRIPTION, MISSING_TRIGGER, BLOATED_SKILL, ORPHAN_REFERENCE, DEAD_CROSS_REF
- **Statistical Rigor** — Wilson score CI, bootstrap CI, Clopper-Pearson exact CI, Elo ranking
- **CLI + Claude Code** — `uv run plugin-eval score/certify/compare` or `/eval`, `/certify`, `/compare` commands
- **CI Gate** — `--threshold` flag exits non-zero below a minimum score

```bash
# Quick evaluation (static only, instant)
uv run plugin-eval score path/to/skill --depth quick

# Standard evaluation (static + LLM judge)
uv run plugin-eval score path/to/skill --depth standard

# Full certification (all layers + Elo)
uv run plugin-eval certify path/to/skill
```

### Three-Tier Model Strategy

Strategic model assignment for optimal performance and cost:

| Tier | Claude Model | Qwen Model | Agents | Use Case |
|------|-------------|------------|--------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | Opus 4.6 / Fable 5 | **Qwen-Max** | 56 | Critical architecture, security, code review, production coding |
| **Tier 2** | Inherit | **Inherit** | 52 | Complex tasks - uses your session's default model |
| **Tier 3** | Sonnet 4.6 | **Qwen-Plus** | 70 | Docs, testing, debugging, API design, DX optimization |
| **Tier 4** | Haiku 4.5 | **Qwen-Flash** | 24 | Fast operational tasks (SEO, deployment, content) |

**Tier 2 Flexibility (`inherit`):**
Agents marked `inherit` use your session's default model, letting you balance cost and capability.

**Cost Comparison (per 1M tokens):**

| Tier | Claude Cost | Qwen Cost | Savings |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Tier 1 (Max) | $5/$25 (input/output) | ~$0.04 | ~99% |
| Tier 3 (Plus) | $3/$15 | ~$0.02 | ~99% |
| Tier 4 (Flash) | $1/$5 | ~$0.01 | ~99% |
| **Free (OAuth)** | N/A | **$0** | **100%** |

Orchestration patterns combine models for efficiency:

```
Qwen-Max (architecture) → Qwen-Plus (development) → Qwen-Flash (deployment)
```

## Popular Use Cases
